# Multilingual Video Localization Software for Dubbing Using AI
Automatic dubbing of videos from English to Indian regional languages for educational purposes.
# About
Globalization of media and the expansive reach of the internet
Spurred a significant demand for video content that can transcend linguistic boundaries.
Traditional localization methods like subtitling and dubbing face challenges in cost, time, and quality
Demands the necessity of the development of the Multilingual Video Localization Software (MVLS)
# Features
1. Enable multilingual dubbing
2. Ensure quality and scalability
3. Have a User-friendly Interface
# Requirements
Hardware:
Microphone: Required to capture audio from various sources. 
Computer or Server: With sufficient processing power and memory to run the audio processing and translation algorithms effectively.
GPU (Graphics Processing Unit): For accelerating deep learning algorithms used in speech recognition and translation.
Storage: Sufficient storage space is needed to store audio files, intermediate data, and models.
Network Connectivity: Reliable internet connectivity is essential for accessing cloud-based services and APIs, such as the Google Cloud Speech API and Google Cloud Translation API.
Software:
Python: The primary programming language for implementing the audio processing and translation algorithms.
Libraries and Frameworks:
Pydub: Python library for audio processing tasks such as extracting audio from video files, merging audio files, and exporting audio files.
MoviePy: Python library for video editing tasks, including audio extraction and replacement.
Google Cloud SDK: Software development kit for accessing Google Cloud services, including the Speech-to-Text API and Translation API.
Spacy: Python library for natural language processing tasks such as text tokenization and part-of-speech tagging.
